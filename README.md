# nn-explorer

**NN Explorer** is an interactive tool for creating, visualizing, and simulating neural network architectures. It allows you to design models layer-by-layer, connect them visually, automatically calculate shape transformations, and export the architecture as ready-to-use PyTorch code. Ideal for quickly prototyping and understanding model structures without writing code manually.

## Features
- [ ] **Drag-and-Drop**: Add layers from a palette to a central whiteboard.
- [ ] **Visual Connections**: Link layers with automatic validation.
- [ ] **Properties Panel**: Edit layer parameters and set the global input shape.
- [ ] **Shape Propagation**: Automatically calculate input/output sizes for each layer.
- [ ] **Templates**: Load predefined architectures (Simple MLP, LeNet-like CNN).
- [ ] **PyTorch Export**: Generate corresponding `torch.nn` Python code for the designed network.
